    <h1>Arrowhead Stadium</h1>

    <p>
        Arrowhead Stadium is the home of the Kansas City Chiefs. With a capacity of 74,416, it is the sixth largest stadium in the NFL.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Get LOUD!</h2>
    <p>
        While it's not the biggest stadium in the NFL, Arrowhead <em>is</em> the loudest. 
        Because of the roaring fans, opposing teams who make the trip to Kansas City often have difficulty making changes and adjustments at the line of scrimmage.
        It's so loud that offensive players can't hear their own quarterback, and often find themselves flagged for jumping before the play starts, or lining up incorrectly for a play.
    </p>
    <p>
        And it's official: At a Monday Night Football game on September 20, 2015, a judge from Guinness Book of World Records recorded a crowd roar of 142.2 decibels.  
        That's louder than the engine of a 747 at 50 meters, and makes Arrowhead not only the loudest NFL stadium, but the <strong>loudest outdoor stadium in the world!</strong>
